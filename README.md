# PrusaFlashAir
Modification of jayanty's bash script to sync a local folder with a Toshiba W-04 WiFi card. Added ability to sync and overwrite existing files on the FlashAir card if modification date is current day.

Based entirely on this codebase (https://github.com/jayanty/PrusaFlashAir).

Dependencies:
A lot of the backend heavy lifting is done using this codebase (https://github.com/CrashCash/FlashAirScripts) so you will need to install that first.
